Largest Product
===============

Given a list of unsorted integers and a positive integer `k`, draw `k` elements
from the list that makes the largest product.

Suppose the following input is given,

    [1, -9, 5, 0, 7, 3, -8, -1], k = 3

Then we would like to return `[-9, -8, 7]`. You may assume `k` is equal to or less than the number of elements in the list.

What are the time complexity and the space complexity of your solution?
