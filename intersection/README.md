Intersection
============

Given two sorted lists of integers, find the intersection of the two lists.

For example, suppose two lists are given as:

    xs = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
    ys = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]

Then your solution should return `[3, 21]`.

Time limit: 10 min

Variation
---------
What if one list is significantly larger than the other? For example, one
contains billions of elements whereas the other only contains several. Would
it possible to come up with a more efficient solution?
